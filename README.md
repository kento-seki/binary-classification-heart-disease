# PredictHeartDisease

In this project, I implement the random forest algorithm from scratch on a heart disease dataset (source: https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction).

Usage: 
* To develop models, run the 'main' script and follow prompts
* To change the hyperparameters of the random forest algorithm, go to line 88 in main.py

### 16th January 2023: an added note

Admittedly, looking back at this project makes me cringe a little.

I completed this project less than a year after I first started programming, and VERY early into my experience with Python programming. I didn't know what sklearn was, nor did I really understand object-oriented programming. This project is an extremely naive implementation of the random forest algorithm... but at the end of the day, it served its purpose of ingraining the workings of the algorithm in my mind.
